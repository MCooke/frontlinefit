	<h1>Strength Camp</h1>
	<p class="lead">is our most popular addition to adding as much lean muscle mass to your physique as safely, naturally, and effectively</p>
</div>

<p>Our 12 Week Strength Camp is our most popular addition to adding as much lean muscle mass to your physique as safely, naturally, and effectively in one of the most efficient ways possible here at Front Line Fit.
The 12 week plan James Largey and Nik Dodd have devised from both being your typical ‘hard gainer’ some time ago.</p>

<p>The result – James added an incredible 10kg of lean muscle (around 22lbs) in the first 3 months of following this program, following up with another 20kg spread over the following year. What makes this feat even more striking is that both James and Nik started out weighing just 60kg. However whilst Nik focused on strength gains as opposed to body mass, James managed to increased his actual body weight by almost 15% in just twelve weeks while not adding any unwanted fat. Not to mention this was after years of frustration, misguided effort through boxing, circuit training and even listening to unknowledgeable personal trainers providing all the wrong advice also known as ‘bro science’.</p>

<p>The 12 week Strength Camp program is based on your individual goal, and over the years we have adapted the group training into sub categories to obtain incredible results for not only strength and muscle development, but also improvements in sporting performance and dropping copious amounts of body fat quite evidently shown through our transformation pictures.  </p>

<p>Depending on whether you want to add lean muscle mass or drop body fat. improve your max lifts by 1kg or 100kg. Whatever you desire, we have the plan of action ready and waiting. 
Special note for “hard gainers” - In twelve weeks you are not going to go from being skinny to a super hero; as you may well know - building lean muscle tissue takes time. What James and Nik will both teach you is ways to add muscle far quicker than many so-called experts will claim is possible alongside substantially increasing your strength and performing complex lifts with the safest, most effective techniques possible… After all what fun is it looking strong if you’re weak as a mouse?</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Your bio signature and goal setting determines what style of training you will need to do in order to achieve your goal and in turn will determine which “sub group” you shall be training with for a a period of the 12 week program. Through out the 12 week course, your training, diet and supplement protocols all have the ability to change due to your body shape changing, goals being hit sooner than anticipated, and how you react hormonally to certain factors we have put into place - which is why we document the following information every step of the way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strength &amp; Muscular Endurance</li>
  <li>Body Fat %</li>
  <li>Specific location of fat storage (e.g legs, stomach, back etc.) - Target spot reduction.</li>
  <li>Hormone profile</li>
  <li>Energy levels</li>
  <li>Sleep Pattern</li>
  <li>Stress Levels</li>
  <li>Diet Quality</li>
  <li>Cosmetic use</li>
  <li>Posture Analysis</li>
  <li>Other Relevant Variables</li>
</ul>

<p>We have waiting lists for all of our Strength Camp sessions. Why? Because our clients get results and the demand is extremely high - Simple!</p>

<p>We’d love to be more accessible. However our regular personal training clients usually want to step up their training and get in more sessions, without breaking the bank in which case we usually advise Strength Camp. We want to run as many high quality, carefully constructed, physically demanding sessions as possible, yet we also run many other services and camps on a daily basis therefore this is not physically possible. We want FLF to be affordable and accessible to anyone! So we spent around six months experimenting with some new workout approaches that would match the standard of our one-to-one training but in a small group (15 clients x 3 trainers).</p>

<p>It took some effort, a big investment and a whole heap of patience to get it right. But after a lot of trial and error in the early days of “bulk camp” we concluded that the FLF Strength Camp had to fit the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help achieve outstanding results. We’re becoming famous for helping people get “next level” results. We want our Strength Campers to get closer to the body or level of fitness or performance they’ve always wanted, but never quite been able to achieve or afford via the required amount of PT sessions or coaching to obtain.
    <ul>
      <li>Include a blend of awesome people who bounce off one another during and after the sessions are over 
  Everyone at Strength Camp help one another tremendously and give huge amounts of support during the sessions and afterwards with advice on the diet and supplements via our private forum group for Strength Campers ONLY. Not to mention its FUN! Anyone who has been to an FLF session will tell you that there’s nothing but an amazing “family feeling.” When you are part of a team your training process becomes much more fun and you become accountable to more people than just yourself and your trainer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small enough to keep standards of quality high. Which is why we have capped the Strength Camp number off at 15 people per group session, of which we have a MINIMUM of 1 trainer per 5 clients (sometimes more).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Available both day and night. We found that there were many who enjoyed training at night however there were also those who enjoyed morning/day sessions, so we created a number of optional camps for clients to choose which times/days they preferred.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Flexible. At the price you’re paying you don’t get the same flexibility as one-to-one personal training due to all of the sessions being fixed to a specific day and time. However the way we have devised the sessions allows you to pay a small fee (£10) to complete a “catch up session” for any sessions of your program of which you may have missed at a time that suits you providing you haven’t left the “catch up period” too far between sessions.</li>
</ul>

<p>So whether you’re a current personal training client, or have never been to FLF Performance Centre before, come and join Strength Camp.</p>

<p>There are a number of classes to choose from to suit you:
1. Monday 11.30am-12.30, Wednesday 11.30am-12.30, Friday 11.30am-12.30.
2. Monday 6pm-7pm, Wednesday 6pm-7pm, Friday 6pm-7pm
3. Monday 7pm-8pm, Wednesday 7-8pm, Friday 7-8pm
4. Tuesday 7-8pm, Thursday 7-8pm, Saturday 10am-11am</p>

<p>Choose ONE  group (line) for the entire 12 weeks. Please note you will not be able to mix and match groups and times.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h2>

<p>Due to extremely high demand and only limited spaces available - To ensure maximum quality during our sessions we ask each member to make a promise to the trainers and themselves that they are willing to do the following before considering joining the Strength Camp 12 Week Course:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Give 100% effort and attention to detail during sessions and in the kitchen. </li>
  <li>Attend every single session (if any are to be missed we also hold catch up sessions for a small fee of £10) </li>
  <li>Push yourself and encourage your teammates to succeed in achieving all the goals set on day one. </li>
  <li>Pay £200 as a deposit before the Camp starts via cash or bank transfer – this ensures your place is secure and you are committed. contact info@frontlinefit.co.uk to make the transfer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-training-will-i-be-doing">What kind of training will I be doing?</h2>

<p>As stated above - your training will be SPECIFIC to your goal and body type/hormone profile. Therefore you may be lifting heavy compound lifts for 1-5 reps in power lifting fashion, or you may be required to specifically focus on strict hypertrophy sets with slow eccentrics with super sets, drop sets, pause reps, explosive plyometrics or other training approaches and manipulative variables - who knows? I cannot stress how important it is to know exactly what type of training YOU need to follow to achieve your individual goals.</p>

<p>REMEMBER - THERE IS NO ‘ONE SIZE FITS ALL’ FOR DIET, TRAINING OR SUPPLEMENTATION. Therefore it is our job at Front Line Fit to figure out what will work best for you.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-it-cost">What will it cost?</h2>

<p>£500 - One off Payment to secure your place on the next Strength Camp.
How do I find out when the next course starts?</p>

<p>All of our courses at Front Line Fit start at specific times therefore you will need to contact jason@frontlinefit.co.uk for more info or call 07816231153</p>
