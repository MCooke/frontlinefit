		1: "The chin and the cheek are the early detection system for fat loss in a new client. We measure these folds because they are usually the first areas to change. These sites aren't linked to any particular hormone imbalance but act as an indicator as to whether or not the plan is effective.",
		2: "Pectoral and/or triceps - These two sites are what are called “The BioSignature androgen sites”. High pectoral or high tricep readings in men can reflect an androgen imbalance which makes it far more difficult to add lean muscle mass. This is particularly so when both pectoral and triceps have high readings. By monitoring and modulating these sites, you produce more testosterone naturally. You also prevent aromatization. Aromatization is a counter-productive metabolic process that is the result of the chemical conversion of testosterone to estrogen (female hormone), which for males can result in severe cases of gynecomastia (fatty breast tissue behind the nipple area) and for women “flabby bingo wings” (fatty looking triceps).",
		3: "Subscapularis (back fat) or iliac Crest (love handles) are two sites of which are predictors of insulin management and blood sugar regulation. The subscapularis is most closely related to your genetic sensitivity of your own insulin. The iliac crest, while also a measure of relative insulin resistance, is also a marker for recent insulin management - therefore it is relatively easy for me to take note of two things: do you need to lower your carbohydrate intake, and informs me of weather you are following the diet or not! This is a polite way of saying how many carbohydrates or CAKES you have been eating. Proper insulin management is of prime importance in achieving fat loss, as well as preventing diabetes Type II. Some would go as far as to say that the more insulin you produce, the faster you age. Luckily with our plan, this is one of the easiest hormones to control by yourself. People who learn to manage their insulin properly usually show dramatic improvements in body composition and body fat within a short time.",
		4: "The Midaxillary fold is associated with functioning of the thyroid gland. The functioning of the thyroid gland is dependent upon proper levels of zinc, iodine, and other trace minerals, as well as the relative absence of toxins, such as heavy metals. It therefore indicates how effective your metabolism works and if you are burning enough calories at rest. Which at the moment for YOU is not the case.",
		5: "It is estimated that we have over 100 times more stress then our grandparents. It’s no surprise that a large portion of people struggling to lose weight around the middle (like yourself) are suffering from elevated cortisol. There are numerous causes for this, and laboratory testing can be inaccurate due to the fact that the effects of cortisol happen over weeks and months. BioSignature not only tells you if cortisol is an issue, it also helps narrow down why it is an issue and what you can do about it. More importantly, it gives you practical solutions for your lifestyle, because for most of us, quitting our jobs and hiring a full time assistant are not viable options. Elevated stress and cortisol levels increase abdominal fat, and make it harder for your body to regulate insulin. Cortisol is an adrenal hormone that is made in response to stressful circumstances – training, working, business negotiations, relationships, alcohol consumption, poor sleep quality etc. Fat around the belly button is a reflection of demand for cortisol production. The demand for production of cortisol is what affects the thickness site, not the level of cortisol that you actually produce. The level of cortisol you are able to produce is a function of the strength and nutritional status of your adrenal glands. Due to the fact that stomach fat is currently a high priority, it is extremely important that we reduce any possible situations of which may include long bouts of cortisol production on a daily basis caused by interacting with stressful situations. This means - no aerobic/cardio activity, ensuring we are fully hydrated, not over consuming alcohol, sugar, caffine etc. I will also put together a list further on in this report with more information to assist you.",
		6: "Yet due to the fact Umbilicus (stomach) is only third priority, it is crucial that we take this one step at a time and focus on the first two before we focus directly on the stomach. The quicker you are successful with the first two, the sooner we can specifically target ‘spot reduction’ for the stomach.",
		7: "The knee and calf sites are a function of growth hormone (GH) production according to Biosignature Modulation™. The knee tends to be indicative of more immediate improvements in growth hormone production, while the calf changes more slowly. Both of these sites tend to improve when sleep quality, quantity, or both increase alongside a strength training program.",
		8: "Biosignature Modulation™ states that the sites of the quadriceps and hamstrings are a function of estrogen levels and estrogen ratios. This is a common BioSignature™ site in females or males who carry ‘higher than average’ female hormones. Through dietary intervention, supplementation, and lifestyle management – Biosignature Modulation™ helps you turn on the lypolitic (fat burning) genes and turn off the lypogenic (fat storing) ones.",
		9: "Due to the fact that pectoral, and umbilicus are your top 2 priority sites, it is very important that we monitor your levels of stress throughout the day, and we try to keep training volume to a minimum. This means shorter more intense sessions focusing on heavy compound lifts will be beneficial when it comes to dropping body fat, and keeping cortisol as low as possible whilst increasing your body’s ability to produce natural testosterone.",
		10: "High readings here when paired with the triceps may reflect poor insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate intolerance. Therefore, suggestions for your diet will be to drastically reduce complex starchy carbohydrates (rice, oats, potatoes, bread etc) until these sites have lowered in body fat and you have become more ‘insulin sensitive’ (optimum carbohydrate management) as apposed to being insulin resistant (struggling to handle carbohydrates in a sufficient manner).",
		11: "High body fat here in relation to the triceps can be correlated to high estrogen levels, however, they are also closely related to blood sugar management. Through manipulation of the hormone profile and energy systems, lactate threshold training is particularly effective here.",
		12: "Due to the fact you could not taste anything on the zinc test, this suggests that you are zinc deficient and would need to supplement zinc. However, it is very important that it is not just your top of the mill “health store zinc”. It must be Orotate and Aspartate, chelated (you can find this information on the ingredients section).",
		13: "Due to the fact you only had a slight taste of zinc on the zinc test, this suggests that you are slightly zinc difficient and would need to supplement zinc but only in small doses. However, it is very important that it is not just your top of the mill “health store zinc” it has to be Orotate and Aspartate, chelated (you can find this information on the ingredients section).",
		14: "Due to the fact you could clearly taste zinc on the zinc test, this suggests that you are NOT zinc difficient, and therefore will not need to include zinc within your protocol of supplements.",
		15: "Supplementing with zinc and magnesium along with taking a high quality multi-vitamin can help increase natural production of testosterone. Zinc, for instance, is directly responsible for inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. And due to the fact that your Number 1 priority fat site is directly related to low testosterone-GH/high estrogen conversion, its strongly advisable to start supplementing zinc.",
		16: "Because you do not suffer from any food intolerance - or simply you are unaware of any ‘intolerance’ due to small or unnoticeable side effects, it would be wise to eliminate the majority of them from your diet for the meantime - such as wheat, dairy, soy, yeast and corn (possibly eggs & nuts on the odd occasion to “self test” via elimination and reintroduction diet mentioned above). Simply reducing exposure to these foods may reduce the stress on the gastrointestinal and immune system lowering stress hormone output which obviously leads to a reduction in the Umbilicus site! However, if this is not an issue for you I would just strongly suggest the elimination of the ones highlighted in bold writing only - for now at least.",
		17: "Especially (Insert here chosen intolerance) as this will be a major influence towards “leaky gut” syndrome if you do not avoid contact over the coming weeks/months. Simply reducing exposure to this type of food may reduce the stress on the gastrointestinal and immune system thereby lowering stress hormone output which will obviously lead to a reduction in Umbilicus site!",
		18: "From the answer you have given to me it is quite clear that you are not going to the toilet as regularly as you should, for optimal health. Fibre is important for making solid stools and helping food move through the digestive tract; as such, it is a key factor in helping to prevent many digestive disorders. It would be wise of you to take a probiotic. Probiotics are tiny, “good” bacteria that naturally occur in the gastrointestinal tract and destroy harmful bacteria, improve bowel movements and aid digestion. Some rich sources of probiotics are dairy products such as yogurt; for those who have an intolerance to dairy products, probiotic supplements are available and more details on these are prescribed later on.",
		19: "Going off the answers you have given, food digestion  does not seem to be a major issue and toxin excretion through regular stool pattern is healthy, therefore we can focus our energy on more relevant components of regular hindering occurrence within your individual Biosigniture Modulation",
		20: "If the only thing you are regular about is being constipated, you know your gut is unhealthy and detoxification will be severely impaired. Toxins have to actually be eliminated from the body, they don’t just magically disappear from your tissue when you do a cleanse. You must aid detoxification by supporting the kidneys and the gut. If toxins break free in the large intestine, they will go back into circulation and are not removed from the body = a very bad situation. You may have to consider receiving a colonic at the start of your detox phase. Everyone who suffers from constipation should take a probiotic at the end of meals to increase the rate of survival of microbiota in the GI tract. A big reason that the detoxification process is halted is due to inflammation in the gut, which can be caused by unhealthy bacteria. A probiotic will help fight pathogenic bacteria and aid elimination of toxins, while minimising inflammation. You must also drink more water. One of the primary causes of constipation is insufficient water intake. The issue with constipation is that it fosters an imbalance of bacteria, causing inflammation of the lining of the intestines.",
		21: "Due to psychological stress not specifically being an issue for you, this defeats one possible route for your belly fat to increase.",
		22: "You also answered low (1-3) in regards to current physical stress, this defeats the other possible route for your belly fat to increase.",
		23: "Overall, your stress levels seem fairly low, and this, to a certain degree, makes our job much easier to monitor and control stomach fat through chronic stress and cortisol production.",
		24: "Now although you have stated your overall stress levels as being relatively low, your body fat analysis states that one of your top 3 priority sites is Umbilicus (stomach) which means your cortisol production and stomach fat must be contributed through something else, which could be: Chronic dehydration Food Intolerance (Usually sugar and/or alcohol) Food or drink toxicity Poor diet Lack of sleep (or broken sleep) Poor gut health Over training with high volume cardio (aerobic activity) Being on or have been on an “extreme calorie restricted diet” More than one thing mentioned above.",
		25: "Since psychological stress may be an issue for you due to answering a “moderate 4-7” on the question and answer section of your bio sig report, It would be extremely wise to take note of what makes you feel stressed and try to gain control. ",
		26: "You also answered moderate (4-7) in regards to current physical stress.  Therefore, if there is any possible way to reduce the longevity of physical stress on your body on a day to day basis - NOW would be the time to make that reduction!",
		27: "Although being ‘moderately stressed,’ seems “the norm” to most people, it is very important for you to know how this will negatively impact your ability to lose body fat and/or increase lean muscle mass, alongside negatively impacting recovery time between sessions.",
		28: "Stress will shorten your life, make you fat, stunt your training results, and make you a poor performer in every area of your life. You MUST minimize your stress if you want to achieve your potential!",
		29: "Stress is not a state of mind, but something measurable and dangerous. It is not an abstract concept that maybe you should do something about someday. You need to do something about it TODAY. The effect of psychological stress can easily be seen in the body. Stress IS the plaque buildup in the arteries or the fat around your middle. For example, cortisol will actually decrease plasticity and the ability to make connections in the brain. Fewer brain circuits will lead to brain atrophy. The result is poor memory and less cognitive function. Yes, stress makes you stupid!",
		30: "You also answered high (8-10) in regards to current physical stress.  Therefore, if there is any possible way to reduce the longevity of physical stress on your body on a day to day basis - NOW would be the time to make that reduction! This is a BIG factor for you to consider if you want to see some real results happen over the coming weeks.",
		31: " Although being ‘stressed,’ seems “the norm” to most people, it is very important for you to know how this will negatively impact your ability to loose body fat and/or increase lean muscle mass, alongside negatively impacting recovery time between sessions.",
		32: "In fact, I would put your high levels of stress down as a main contributor to the reason why umbilicus (stomach) is one of your top 3 major sites. It is very important for you to understand that cortisol (specifically when chronically elevated over time), makes your body think it needs to store fat around the waist in order to provide a source of easily accessible energy in anticipation of more intense stress in the near future. Time again I have come across new clients who prove the reason that they may not be able to lose fat even when they are doing everything right in terms of their training- and diet - is because of constantly elevated cortisol.",
		33: "Cortisol is a low grade form of adrenalin and ideally should elevate right before waking in order to naturally wake you up. The spike in cortisol before you awake is what naturally wakes you up. However, if cortisol does not spike up in the morning, which seems to be the case with you, then you will be very tired and groggy. It may take 5 cups of coffee and a good slap in the face to get moving. (I’m joking!

Chemical cleaners contain toxins and estrogen-mimicking compounds. Opt for plant-based cleaners. Don’t trust it just because it says “green” on the label. Check ingredients. 3)    Use natural personal care products such as shampoo and conditioner. These are the same as cleaning products—don’t trust it just because it says “natural” on the label.

		77: "It’s fat loss time for many people, and for you personally, sleep is obviously an overlooked variable that plays a huge role in your ability to turn hard training and clean eating into a better body. Studies show that the amount of sleep people need is very individualised, but chronic sleep deprivation will derail all your transformation efforts. First, acute (short term) lack of sleep decreases insulin sensitivity and leads to elevated blood sugar, shifting the body into fat storage mode. Research suggests that lack of sleep leads people to eat more and opt for foods that are higher in carbs and fat. Second, being tired means you will experience more stress—both psychologically and physically. “Without enough sleep, we all become tall two-year-olds.” You can add hungry, fat, slow, dumb, mean, angry, sick, and eventually dead to the list of the effects of lack of sleep. It’s true; you’d die of sleep deprivation before you’d die of starvation! Researchers suggest that eating a high-protein diet is ideal for achieving overall better sleep, but eating a meal of carbohydrates in the evening can help you go to sleep quickly if you are “lean enough” (below 12% in my opinion is the safe zone). Some studies show high-glycemic carbs shorten sleep onset but may negatively affect sleep quality. A smart move is to opt for whole-food carbs rather than anything baked or processed, such as cookies, cake or ice cream. Not to mention supplementing Magnesium. Magnesium calms the nervous system, fights inflammation and high levels of stress in the form of cortisol which leads to poor sleep. A recent study of people with poor sleep as measured by a sleep quality index found that taking a magnesium supplement improved sleep quality by 60 percent and also decreased inflammatory stress makers.",

Avoid magnesium in the form of carbonate, oxide or gluconate because they are cheap forms and poorly absorbed - usually the ones you find in Holland & Barret for a few quid!

By any chance, if you need to get up in the middle of the night, keep the light off and keep one eye closed. Turning the light on and opening both eyes will instantly interrupt the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Some researchers even advance that being awake longer than 3 seconds during the night is enough to interrupt melatonin production. and this can limit your potential for natural hormone balance and recovery from previous sessions.",
		83: "Endless jokes are made about new parents not getting enough sleep, but it’s no laughing matter. Lack of sleep or having interrupted sleep unquestionably affects your physical health, and you’ll be emotionally drained even before your day begins. Although newborns generally don’t sleep for more than four and a half hours at a time, this pattern will change. If you provide an environment conducive to nighttime and daytime sleep, such as using minimal lighting and talking in a soft voice when it’s time for their sleep time, you will promote a more natural sleep cycle for them. Although having a baby fall asleep in your arms is a wonderful experience, doing so on a regular basis establishes a pattern that can become difficult to break. Now let’s get back to you. Insomnia is a general term describing the inability to sleep well. One type of insomnia is not being able to get to sleep, and another type is being able to get to sleep but not being able to stay asleep.  Often, a single supplement can resolve chronic sleep disorders – case in point: magnesium. The times you frequently wake up at night can also reflect internal problems that need to be addressed: Chinese Medicine and other forms of alternative medicine have determined certain times we wake up can mean specific internal problems Here are the times: Waking Before 1am= poor blood sugar handling and poor overall quality diet. Waking Between 1-3am= Poor Liver function, Waking Between 3-5 AM= Lung Meridian and Oxidative Stress Waking Between 5-7AM= or right before you are to typically wake up = Sometimes triple warmer and poor thyroid function. Now these times are not “etched” in stone, but this would be typical for someone who goes to bed between 9pm and 11pm. If you go to bed at other times, the waking patterns will be changed somewhat.  Also, a common thought in Eastern Medicine is that the time between 11pm and 12am is when the body begins the “detoxifying process” and if you “miss” that window of time by staying up late, the process will not occur as effectively that night or will not occur at all.",
		84: "Waking Before 1am= poor blood sugar handling and poor overall quality diet. If you have a poor overall diet and your blood sugar is all over the place then typically you will wake up not long after going to bed because of poor overall insulin health",

		89: "Due to the fact that you have mentioned you do not eat many meals per day, I think it is important for me to make you aware that... when you are not eating enough regular meals per day and essentially “starving your body” it is NOT WORKING FOR YOU!... And that is simply because when you don’t eat, you often experience low blood glucose, or hypoglycemia, during which adrenaline is released to elevate blood sugar to keep you going. This leads to sharp elevations in glucose and insulin, causing insulin resistance and impeding fat loss. Hypoglycemia can also lead to chronically imbalanced hormone production—a classic example of a “broken” body. This is where you are at currently if you are over weight yet don’t eat “very often”. Ladies, be aware that there’s also evidence that “intermittent fasting” and hypoglycemia can inhibit fertility and lead to more negative physiological changes in women than what men experience. Intermittent fasting is not all golden for men either—rodent studies suggest skipping meals can produce adrenal dysfunction.“I’m not a morning person”.... “I don’t eat breakfast” The reality for most people is that if they get breakfast right, and thus get their day off to a ‘healthy’ start, they are likely to make better choices throughout the day.  This is something to do with blood sugar management and appetite regulation, but perhaps more to do with starting the day with mindful and positive choices about certain goals and overall health.  Start the day with that mindset and it will more than likely filter through to the rest of your day. Breakfast is the most challenging meal of the day to get ‘right’ for most people, no doubt.

You stated that you eat around 6 or so total meals and/or with snacks per day which is great, however you MUST make sure protein is included with each meal... plus smart fats where possible. One of the biggest secrets most of my clients who have had amazing results in the past have shared was to have a bowl of broccoli, cauliflower or green beans with every meal possible. Most people haven’t got the guts to force themselves to do this but those who do this will experience rapid fat loss. The more greens in your diet, the leaner you will become, due to the thermogenic effect of these foods.

		92: "Since your goal is to increase sports performance, there are just a couple of small considerations I want you to bare in mind with regards to training. If you are an endurance athlete and want to improve performance, we will need to do a strength-type program with heavy loads (80 percent of the 1RM or heavier) in order to increase short-term and long-term endurance capacity. Performing strength training WON’T compromise endurance performance or result in measurable hypertrophy if it is done in conjunction with regular endurance training. KEY NOTE: If you are a power athlete, AVOID conditioning unless it is very short and very intense. Concurrent training leads to a very significant decrease in power output. The drop in power corresponds to the length of the endurance exercise, and lower intensity conditioning leads to a much greater loss of power. Power is the performance variable that is compromised the MOST by endurance exercise—much more than strength or hypertrophy are. For the Athlete For competitive athletes, every little bit counts. The difference between winning and losing can be hundredths of a second, an inch, a point, or a pound. This makes it so important to get the most out of your diet and supplement program.
