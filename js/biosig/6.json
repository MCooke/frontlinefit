		"1": "If the only thing you are regular about is being constipated, you know your gut is unhealthy and detoxification will be severely impaired. Toxins have to actually be eliminated from the body, they donâ€™t just magically disappear from your tissue when you do a cleanse. You must aid detoxification by supporting the kidneys and the gut. If toxins break free in the large intestine, they will go back into circulation and are not removed from the body = a very bad situation. You may have to consider receiving a colonic at the start of your detox phase. <br/>Everyone who suffers from constipation should take a probiotic at the end of meals to increase the rate of survival of microbiota in the GI tract. A big reason that the detoxification process is halted is due to inflammation in the gut, which can be caused by unhealthy bacteria. A probiotic will help fight pathogenic bacteria and aid elimination of toxins, while minimising inflammation. <br/>You must also drink more water. One of the primary causes of constipation is insufficient water intake. The issue with constipation is that it fosters an imbalance of bacteria, causing inflammation of the lining of the intestines."
